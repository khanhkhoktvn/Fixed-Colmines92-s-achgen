# Fixed Colmines92's achgen
The OG: https://github.com/Colmines92/achgen
Seems like steamdb just changed the html a bit so I was can not take the achivements list. So I make a bit change to brings it back to life.


USAGE:

    THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE MEANT TO BE PERFORMED ON A DESKTOP BROWSER.

    1. Search your game at https://steamdb.info/
    2. Choose your game id from the list.
    3. Click on achievements, then download both the html file and the folder ending with '_files'.
    4. Drag the downloaded html into the app executable icon and wait for it to finish.
